# Code for the paper "Practical Crowdsourcing of Wearable IoT Data with Differential Privacy"

The code in this repo allows to reproduce the experiments in the paper.

- `exp1a_query_mean.py` runs the experiments for mean estimation and computes the RMSE.

- `exp1b_query_count.py` runs the experiments for ICDF estimation and computes the RMSE.

- `exp2_ttest.py` runs the experiments for p-value estimation in Student t-test and computes the agreement rate.

- `exp3_linkattack.py` runs the experiments for the performance evaluation of de-anonymization attacks.
